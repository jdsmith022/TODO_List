Vanilla Javascript ToDo List


To update .css files from .scss files run command in terminal: 
```
sass --watch sass/:stylesheets
```

To install sass command: 
```
brew install sass/sass/sass
```
or
```
npm install -g sass
```

NOTE: Use of local storage is not secure for user login and shoud not be considered a realistic solution to user loging. This is an exercise in Vanilla JavaScript. I choose not to use jquery. As I am still new to Javascript, I wanted to be able to show I can learn and understand the basics of Javascript to build a strong foundation and move onto to use jquery, versus the other way around.
