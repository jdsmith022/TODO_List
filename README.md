# TODO_List
## Vanilla Javascript ToDo Lisl in HTML using local storage.

![Demo of todoList](https://github.com/jdsmith022/TODO_List/blob/master/images/ezgif.com-crop.gif)

## Description
First exercise completed in Vanilla Javascript. I will make better implementations as I learn. I chose to use Vanilla Javascript instead of jQuery in order to build a strong foundtion in understanding how Javascript works to then understand fully jQuery.

### Installation

From terminal, the program can be install with git clone with the project repository, followed by the name of the directory you wish to download the repository to.

#### Example
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jdsmith022/fdf.git [directory-name]
```

### Usage
With Visual Studios add Live Server extension. Open repo in new window and Go Live. Navigate to pages and login page will open.
Else, browers from repo directory. Inside file the repo was dowloaded to, click on the pages directory. Inside, right click on the index.html file. Click open with, and choose your preffered browser.

New users can join or login to their todo list. At their todo list, users can add, deleted or check off items to their list. They can add a filter upon entering each item so filter through list based on: All, Completed, Uncompleted, or their chosen added filter.

When users logout, their list and each items filter and stats are saved.

### Prerequisite
To update .css files from .scss files run command in terminal:
```
sass --watch sass/:stylesheets
```

To install sass command:
```
brew install sass/sass/sass
```
or
```
npm install -g sass
```

NOTE: Use of local storage is not secure for user login and shoud not be considered a realistic solution to user loging. This is an exercise in Vanilla JavaScript. I choose not to use jquery. As I am still new to Javascript, I wanted to be able to show I can learn and understand the basics of Javascript to build a strong foundation and move onto to use jquery, versus the other way around.
